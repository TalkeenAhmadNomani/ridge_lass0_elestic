Regression Models with Feature Engineering

## What I Learned
Implementing Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Elastic Net models.
Understanding the impact of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization in reducing overfitting.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.


## What I Revised

Feature Engineering techniques for improving model accuracy.
Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
Evaluating regression models using RMSE, RÂ² score, and cross-validation.
